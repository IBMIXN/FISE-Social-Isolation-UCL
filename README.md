# IBM FISE Lounge

> IBM FISE Lounge is an application that acts as a smart, collaborative workout coach for the elderly to use in the current pandemic, where loneliness is becoming a major issue. It provides a simple interface with a standalone dashboard for more tech-savvy relatives to set up the Lounge app and preferences on the elderly relative's behalf.

# Server Documentation

## Overview

- Running on NextJS 9 (different to Express, look it up and be familiar with ES5/ES6 syntax)
- Auth handled by Passport
- Storage in MongoDB (Can easily set up using Atlas)
- All API routes at `localhost:3000/api/*`
- All dashboard pages at `localhost:3000/*`
- All API routes are "pages" in NextJS 9
- All pages are in `/server/pages`, with API routes in `/server/pages/api` and the file path from pages corresponding to the actual path

## Data Types

### User

- The actual account administrator
- They manage the *Consumer*'s FISE account and set it up on the *Consumer*'s device
- They can add mutiple *Consumer*s and add multiple *Contact*s per *Consumer*
- This is the only person who ever accesses the Dashboard

### Consumer

- The elderly person with difficulty contacting their relatives
- This person's data will show up on the FISE app
- Can be related to multiple *Contact*s

### Contact

- Someone the *Consumer* can call
- Will receive an email when called through the app

## Deploying the Server

Easiest way: Vercel

- Connect repo to Vercel
- Add all env variables that are in `/server/.env.local.example`
- (NB: Adding `VERCEL_URL` will autopopulate based on whether the build is production or preview)

Otherwise: Server

- Follow the above instructions for *Server Installation* and expose port 3000
